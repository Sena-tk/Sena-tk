各種有料ソフトウェアで解析した方が簡単で正確だなと思いつつ、Rでも解析ができるようになりたい。<br>
miceroarrayとRNA-Seqはウェットとドライ両方ちょっとだけ経験済み。<br>
いまは趣味の範囲ですが、お仕事で手元にデータがあるので活かしたい。<br>
AIも興味津々。PC組み立てるような家庭で育ち、自宅サーバー持ちの夫と結ばれるも未だITは初心者。<br>
学歴は短大までですが現場作業経験が長い、ただのアルバイトです。<br><br>

While I think it’s easier and more accurate to analyze with various paid software, it would be fun if I could also analyze with R.<br>
I have experience with both wet and dry in microarray and RNA-Seq.<br>
It’s just a hobby for now, but I have data at hand for work, so it would be nice if I could make use of it.<br>
I grew up in a home where we assemble PCs, and I’m married to a husband who has a home server, but I’m a beginner in IT.<br>
My academic background only goes up to junior college, so I don’t have any academic qualifications, but I have a long experience in field work, just a part-time job.
